# ResizingRemit

Resizing views with SpriteKit within a SwiftUI App, particularly for `SKEmitterNode`.

For a detailed comparison on different approaches on use in SwiftUI, see `../SkinSuit/README.md`

This sample was created when the Purrticles app full-size preview was having problems with emitters that were not centred.
