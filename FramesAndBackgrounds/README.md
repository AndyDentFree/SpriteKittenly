# FramesAndBackgrounds

Assorted tests of tiling backgrounds or rendering with a shader, trying to see what happens when you surround a node with a photo frame, as would be used to compose a greeting card. That's one potential popular use for [Touchgram][tg].

Tap to circle through the various scenes.

Apple has a huge framework [GamePlayKit][GK] for building much of the structure of games. It includes a family of [Procedural Noise Generators][GKNoise]. These are not being used in this sample at this time but may be revisited.
