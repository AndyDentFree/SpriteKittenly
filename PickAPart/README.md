# PickAPart

This sample was created when the [Purrticles app][p1] was having problems with grey views instead of emitters being drawn, in both the picker and preview. See [GitHub issue 23][p2].

It replicates some of the visual behaviour of the document browser opening either a known document or grid of cells for picking the initial template. If this doesn't provide a replicable case, next step may be to do a true document browser in case there's something about its overall navigation view structure that changed in 18.4.
