# SpriteKittenly
Exploring cute and sometimes scratchy corners of SpriteKit with Swift.

See specific README in each project directory

* LottieSprite - unfinished exploration, don't bother
* [SKScribbles](./SKScribbles/) multiple approaches tried with sample images to show smoothness of different drawings, also see the closely-related...
* [streakios](./streakios/) which wraps someone else's work and draws a decaying streak, like I was using in Cocos2D-X
* [StyledTextOverSK](./StyledTextOverSK/) long discussion of how to combine SpriteKit with styled text. I went with an SKLabelNode using NSAttributedString in [Touchgram](https://www.touchgram.com/) because of the performance issues this sample shows.
