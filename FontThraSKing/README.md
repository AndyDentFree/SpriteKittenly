# FontThraSKing

Test of font creation and text over SpriteKit.

This is closely related to the sibling project StyledTextOverSK but specifically is for testing fonts. It was created because of some hard crashes trying to create fonts when I expected at worst an exception or error return.

So, although most of the logic is about iOS font creation, it includes SpriteKit and display over it partly in case there's an interaction.

It also (maybe later) sneaks in some ideas of rendering fonts into sprites with a comparison as to how the typography works out.
