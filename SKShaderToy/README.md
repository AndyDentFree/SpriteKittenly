# SKShaderToy

A testbed for shader editing for shaders used by SpriteKit.

Most shaders are available as examples for [ShaderToy][ST] but there are minor differences between the GLSL used there and that of SpriteKit.

Note that much of this sample has comments referring to `tg` classes from [Touchgram][tg]. SKShaderToy is a testbed for some ideas used in that app so methods were copied across, but there's no build or runtime dependency.
