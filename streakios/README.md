# streakios
Exploring motion streak drawing in SpriteKit with Swift.

Based on the sample from [Matthijs Hollemans](https://gist.github.com/hollance/8671187).

Motion streak code using SKShapeNode that didn't make it into the Ray Wenderlich book [iOS Games by Tutorials](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/ios-games-by-tutorials). 

Relies slightly on [SKTUtils extensions](https://github.com/raywenderlich/SKTUtils) portions copied into this repo so the sample compiles.


## The sample

To jazz up the effect a bit we have a sprite which enlarges to show the touch point you are dragging from.
